I enjoy steering projects from conception to deployment, ensuring they meet or exceed our strategic objectives. I work hard to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, facilitating seamless communication and collaboration across diverse teams. My approach is holistic â€“ focusing on automating processes, mentoring teams, and a "no hard feelings, just troubleshoot" mentatily.

I am passionate about continuous improvement and knowledge sharing. I'm committed to shaping the future of IT and application engineering, making technology an enabler of success for businesses and communities alike. Outside of work, my curiosity drives me to stay ahead of tech trends and give back through community engagement and professional mentorship.
